<h2>Dog Catcher</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
  Play as a dog who has mysteriously forgotten his powerful abilities and must cope with suddenly remembering them.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
  Surprise, tension and possibly some humor.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
  Platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
  Player must figure out the best way to collect a set number of gems (10 in the demo) in a platforming level while staying safe from enemies and adapting to sudden changes in their characters controls. Controls are listed at the top of the screen and randomly change every few seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
  Rapid and unpredictable manipulation of controls and mechanics during gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
  Unique set of controls and elements of randomness.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
  A dog with super natural abilities has awoken with amnesia and must struggle to find out where he is and how to regain his powers.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
  Platformer fans of all ages/demographics.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
  Few minutes for the demo.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
  Strategic timing and maybe even some recklessness. The random elements may introduce some lucky situations that reward risky maneuvers.
